# Ignore data files that are too large or should not be version controlled
# The raw input data is often fine, but large processed data might be ignored.
# For this project, your 'telco_customer_churn_cleaned_encoded.csv' and 'telco_customer_churn_final_features.csv'
# are processed and could be large. You might choose to ignore them and only keep the raw data.
# Or, if they are small enough, keep them to make the repo runnable directly.
# Let's include the processed ones for now, but keep this in mind.
